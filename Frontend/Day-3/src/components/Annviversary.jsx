           <h1> About Us</h1>
           <h3>Getting a gift for someone you love and watching their faces light up with joy is one of the best feelings in the world. The one who gets the gift is often more excited to see the reaction than the one opening it. And you’ll probably agree that a bunch of flowers or a gluten-free cake on such an occasion is just not enough. This is where Oye Happy comes in. We have gathered an extraordinary team of happiness scientists who work every day with a simple idea – to make gifting fun again. And how do we do that? We don’t source boring stuff toys and decorative items from whole-sellers. Instead, we create every gift idea – be it a 24-hour hamper, naming a star after your loved one or a prank glitter bomb – from scratch so that it ends up being as unique as your loved one.

Innovative Gifting Categories Introduced for the First Time in India
Back in the 90s, gifting meant cakes, flowers or cards. 30 years later, nothing much changed – until we stepped in. Oye Happy is the first in the country to introduce innovative product categories to evolve the traditional way of gifting. Our range of Naughty Gifts, for instance, has given Indians a choice to gift board games and first night hampers to their partner. For those who aren’t materialistic and are looking for eco-friendly gifts for mothers or elders, they can choose from our range of social gifts and donate to a cause on the special person’s behalf. We have introduced several innovations in greeting cards in the form of LED-equipped cards, musical cards, and interactive cards. Similarly, we have changed the concept of gift hampers by introducing several personalised gifts and concept-based ideas to keep your loved one surprised throughout the day, week or month.
